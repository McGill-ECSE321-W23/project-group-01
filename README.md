## Description
This repository contains the code of a Parking Lot Management Software System which was developed by our team of 6 (see table below). This project was implemented in the context of our ECSE 321 course (Introduction to Software Engineering).  

This software system aims to provide a fully functional Parking Lot Management System to a client, which would be the owner of the parking lot, so that it helps them coordinate tasks related to spot reservations, parking lot services, hiring of employees to name a few. The Parking Lot Management System allows monthly customers, employees and the owners to access their account and interact with the system in an appropriate way for their respective positions. 

Most Importantly, the system was designed to be adaptable and scalable to accommodate for different types of parking lots (different numbers of spots on each floor, different fees for the spots, etc.). 

The software system was designed to respond to a set of requirements specified by the client through a description which was translated into a set of 15 system requirements (10 functional and 5 functional) which can be seen through the GitHub issues.
